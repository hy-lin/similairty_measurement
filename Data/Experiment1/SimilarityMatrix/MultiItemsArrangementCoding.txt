The similarity matrix measured by Multi-Items Rearrangement task.
Each cell ranges from 0-1640, which indicates the euclidean distance
measured between the items at the current row and column. Since the
particpants were instructed to put similar items closer together,
the larger the number is, the more dissimilar between two items.
