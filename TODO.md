  * Figure of stimulus (with index).
  * Analysis: half done. 
2. Introduction.

  * The adventage of the new task over the old tasks
3. Discussion.

Data analysis

1. ~~Learn how to analysis coeverience matrix.~~
2. ~~AND DO IT.~~
3. ~~reliability and validity test.~~

Miscs:

1. Setup OSF for the paper.
  * I think there is a way to link Github to OSF.
2. Move Participant 10's data from server to local.
3. Document the code, maybe?
  * At least document the data.
