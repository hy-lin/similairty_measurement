This is the project for "similarity measurement" paper.

The paper introduces a new task to measure the similarity matrix: the Multi-Items Rearrangemnet task. Unlike the traditional tasks used to acquire similarity matrix, which present two items at once, the Multi-Items Rearrangement task presents multiple items at once, and participants are instructed to rearrange the items based on the similarity between the items. By presenting multiple items at once, the Multi-Items Rearrangement task is able to acquire the similarity between multiple items in a single trial, which drasically reduced the number of trials required to complete the similarity matrix.

The paper consists of two experiments. Both experiments share the same procedure but with different material. In Experiment 1, abstract faces which consists of 4 different features were used. In Experiment 2, color patches sampled from a continuous color wheel (as in Zhang & Luck, 2007) were used as material.

The Experiment I highlights the potential of the Multi-Items Rearrangement task of acquiring the similarity matrix from complicate item set. The Experiment II demostrates the accuracy of measurement.
(I might switch the order of the experiments around for the sake of writing.)

In the study, the Multi-Items Rearrangement task is accompanied with the Paired-Comparison task. The Paired-Comparison task is served as a validaty measurement and to highlight the time effeciency of the Multi-Items Rearrangement task.
